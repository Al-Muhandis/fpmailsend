Collection of working utilities for sending a simple email message in Free Pascal

Due to the lack of a built-in utility for sending e-mail messages in the modules included in fpc, I decided to collect in one place the maximum number of ways to implement this functionality, both with the help of built-in capabilities of fpc and using third-party libraries

Any help and guidance on new ways to implement this function is welcome, the ultimate goal is to include the native function of sending a simple email message as part of the fcl-net package
